 * Options passed to `SiiliChatbot.init()` when the widget is embedded

 *
 * - `container` — selector or element the widget mounts into.
 * - `apiUrl` — optional backend endpoint. When set, the widget posts
 *   `{ messages: ChatTurn[] }` to this URL; when omitted it falls
 *   back to the bundled mock (see AC-04).
 * - `interceptBackNavigation` — when `true` (the default), the widget
 *   pushes a history entry on the compact → expanded transition
 *   (AC-20c) and listens for `popstate` so the browser back button
 *   dismisses expanded mode (AC-20g). Compact-mode back is never
 *   intercepted (AC-20h). Set to `false` to opt out (AC-20i) — the
 *   close button (AC-20d) and `Esc` (AC-20j) still dismiss, but the
 *   browser back button passes through to host-page navigation.
 * - `privacyPolicyUrl` — optional URL the AC-66 *Käyttöehdot* gate's
 *   long-form body links to (Figma `ds:242:551`). When supplied, the
 *   privacy-policy sentence at the end of the long form renders an
 *   anchor with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` (AC-66b,
 *   mirrors AC-25b's link semantics). When omitted, the sentence
 *   stands alone with no broken-looking placeholder. The URL itself
 *   lives on the host page so it can be rotated without a widget
 *   rebuild — same posture as `apiUrl`.
 * - `locale` — optional widget UI locale (AC-04b / AC-63). Resolution
 *   per §12.1 PD-09: explicit `locale` wins; otherwise
 *   `document.documentElement.lang` is matched against `WidgetLocale`;
 *   otherwise falls back to `'fi'`. Resolved once at `init()` time —
 *   runtime locale switching is out of scope (mid-conversation
 *   switches would mix languages, which AC-63 itself calls out as a
 *   bug).
